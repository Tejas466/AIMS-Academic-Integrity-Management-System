# AIMS-Academic-Integrity-Management-System

# Problem Statement:
**University X**, a prestigious institution renowned for its **innovative IT programs**, faces significant challenges in maintaining **academic integrity** due to the rise of **generative AI technologies**. As these technologies become more common, the risk of **plagiarism** and the difficulty in verifying the **authenticity of student work** have increased. The university seeks effective solutions to **detect and prevent plagiarism**, ensure the **authenticity of student submissions**, and adapt to the rapid advancements in technology.

## 1. Proposed Solution:
To address these challenges, we propose the **Academic Integrity Management System (AIMS)**, which combines **AI-powered plagiarism detection** with **human oversight**, **multi-modal assessment methods**, and **educational initiatives** on ethical AI use. This system provides a **comprehensive and proactive approach** to maintaining academic integrity by integrating:

- **AI and Human Collaboration**: AIMS leverages **AI detection tools** alongside **manual review**, balancing technology with critical human judgment for flagged content.
- **Multi-Modal Verification**: Beyond textual analysis, AIMS includes **oral defenses**, **project logs**, and **interactive assessments**, enabling a holistic review of a student's work and reducing reliance solely on written submissions.
- **Ethical AI Framework**: An embedded **ethical AI framework** educates students on responsible AI use within academic settings and integrates these principles into the curriculum.

## 2. Execution Plan:

### a) **Advanced Plagiarism Detection**
The AIMS system **upgrades traditional plagiarism detection** by using models capable of identifying **patterns specific to AI-generated content**. Through **NLP-based feature extraction**, deep contextual analysis goes beyond simple keyword matching.

### b) **Interactive and Real-Time Assessments**
New assessment methods, such as **live coding exams** and **oral presentations**, challenge students to **demonstrate understanding actively**, making it harder to rely on AI tools for completion.

### c) **Continuous Learning Mechanism**
The AI model is **consistently updated with new data** on emerging AI technologies to adapt dynamically, ensuring it evolves alongside technological advancements.

## 3. Platform Design and Features:

- **Submission Portal**: A **web application interface** allows students to submit assignments, view **AI-based plagiarism reports**, and access **academic resources on ethical AI**.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: The system includes a **clean, intuitive design** accessible by students and educators for **seamless navigation**, plagiarism insights, and direct access to responsible AI guidelines.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Integrated tools provide **immediate feedback** on work originality, fostering learning and reducing repeat offenses.
- **Security and Compliance**: All submissions are **encrypted to protect student privacy** and ensure secure, compliant data handling.

## 4. Implementation:

### **Front-End**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For building a **responsive, user-friendly interface**.
- **React.js**: Frameworks to handle dynamic content and **enhance user interaction**.
- **Bootstrap**: Libraries for creating a **visually appealing and functional layout**.

### **Back-End**
- **Node.js with Express**: For creating **APIs** and handling **server-side logic** efficiently.
- **Python (Flask)**: Used in **AI-related tasks** like **plagiarism detection with Natural Language Processing**.

### **Database**
- **MySQL**: Stores **user submissions, assessments**, and **verification data** securely.

### **Machine Learning**
- **spaCy, NLTK**: For **text preprocessing, tokenization**, and **contextual understanding**.
- **Transformers**: For advanced **AI plagiarism detection**, analyzing the originality of text against known AI-generated patterns.
- **TensorFlow**: Builds and deploys **machine learning models** for identifying AI-generated content.

### **Multi-Modal Verification**
- **OpenCV**: Enables **video analysis** for interactive assessments, such as live coding or presentations.

### **Security**
- **JWT**: For **user authentication and authorization**, ensuring secure login.
- **SSL Encryption**: Protects data during transmission, ensuring **confidentiality**.
